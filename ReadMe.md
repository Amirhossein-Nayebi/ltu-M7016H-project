This is a message about the project work you will be doing as a group (Group 3). Each group will be given a medical image dataset focusing on a specific disease. In your case, the dataset is a compilation of ultrasound images of healthy, benign and malignant breast tissue. Your task is to train a model and evaluate it on the test data. The ultrasound images are not categorized into train/test sets, so you need to divide the data into train/test categories with a ratio of 70 (train)/30(test). You will also have to prepare a 15-20 minute presentation on the model you have trained, the results of your model and the interpretation of the results. You have two weeks to complete the project. We are planning for you to give the presentation on 15 May.
The image dataset can be found at [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/msewflgcj1la9sj/3_ultra_sound_data.zip?dl=0)
